# Minecraft: Survivalism #

_An in-development, complete overhaul mod, with the goal to add more true to life depth and features to Minecraft._

## :earth_americas: _A Brave New World_ ##
- Custom world generation, based upon the [Holdridge Life Zones climate classification.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holdridge_life_zones)
- 38 Base biomes, and if applicable, each include variations of Mountains, Hills, Lowlands & Canyons.
- You must travel far and wide to reach new climates and gain access to different resources.
- A much more accurate to life and aesthetically pleasing colour pallete.
- None of Vanilla Minecraft's blocks or textures are being used, everything is custom and hand drawn using Aseprite.

## :date: _Seasons_ :date: ##
_"So teach us to number our days, so that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."_

- Days & Nights have a dynamic length based upon the season and are longer overall - don't worry, you can still sleep.
- As the seasons change, so will the foliage of non-evergreen leaves.
- Intwined with Survivalism's Agriculture system, understanding crop growth windows is essential for agriculture.

## :seedling: _Agriculture_ :seedling: ##
_"Where tillage begins, other arts follow. The farmers therefore are the founders of human civilization."_

- A brand new, in-depth Agriculture system.
- Soil has fertility values, look after the soil and you will have greater success. 
- Composting & Fertilizers: no more Bonemeal, you cannot instantly grow anything in this mod.
- Lots of new Vegetables, Fruits, Herbs and Flowers.

## :palm_tree: _Arboriculture_ :palm_tree: ##
_"Only in the woods was all at rest within me, my soul became still and full of power."_

- A large number of new Trees, Scrubs, Shrubs and Bushes.
- Fruit trees provide a plethora of ingredients for survival.
- Trees take much longer to grow, be careful of deforestation, make sure you give back what you take.

More description to come as I add features and think up new ideas...

## üç∂ _Pottery_ üç∂ ##
_"Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, what makest thou?"_

- Clay is now an important and has many uses, including Storage vessels, Cookware and Building Blocks.
- No longer will Clay form in tiny circles under shallow lakes, instead you will find Clay in abundance, within certain climates.
